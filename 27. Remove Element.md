## 27. Remove Element (Easy)

https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-element/

### Problem Description

Given an array nums and a value val, remove all instances of that value in-place and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

The order of elements can be changed. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the new length.

**Example 1**:
```
Input: nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3
Output: 2, nums = [2,2]
Explanation: Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2.
It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length. For example if you return 2 with nums = [2,2,3,3] or nums = [2,2,0,0], your answer will be accepted.
```
### Solutions

Javascript:

```javascript
var removeElement = function(nums, val) {
    for(let i=0;i<nums.length;i++){
        if(nums[i]==val){
            nums.splice(i,1);
            i--;
        }
    }
    return nums.length;
};
```


Java:

```java
