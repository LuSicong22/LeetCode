## 1051. Height Checker (Easy)
https://leetcode.com/problems/height-checker/

### Problem Description

A school is trying to take an annual photo of all the students. The students are asked to stand in a single file line in non-decreasing order by height. Let this ordering be represented by the integer array expected where expected[i] is the expected height of the ith student in line.

You are given an integer array heights representing the current order that the students are standing in. Each heights[i] is the height of the ith student in line (0-indexed).

Return the number of indices where heights[i] != expected[i].

**Example 1**:
```
Input: heights = [1,1,4,2,1,3]
Output: 3
Explanation: 
heights:  [1,1,4,2,1,3]
expected: [1,1,1,2,3,4]
Indices 2, 4, and 5 do not match.

```
### Solutions

Javascript:

```javascript
var heightChecker = function(heights) {
    let A=[];
    for(let e of heights){
        A.push(e);
        }
    heights.sort((a,b) => a-b);
    console.log(A);
    console.log(heights);
    let count=0;
    for(let i=0;i<heights.length;i++){
        if(A[i]!=heights[i]){
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```


Java:

```java
//Just count the frequency of each height (using HashMap or int[] as the height is promised to be within range[1, 100]) and use 2 pointers to make comparison
class Solution {
    public int heightChecker(int[] heights) {
        int[] heightToFreq = new int[101];
        
        for (int height : heights) {
            heightToFreq[height]++;
        }
        
        int result = 0;
        int curHeight = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < heights.length; i++) {
            while (heightToFreq[curHeight] == 0) {
                curHeight++;
            }
            
            if (curHeight != heights[i]) {
                result++;
            }
            heightToFreq[curHeight]--;
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
```
