https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-node-in-a-linked-list/


### Solutions

Java:

```java
//We can't really delete the node, but we can kinda achieve the same effect by instead removing 
//the next node after copying its data into the node that we were asked to delete.
 public void deleteNode(ListNode node) {
         node.val=node.next.val;
    node.next=node.next.next;
    }
}
```
